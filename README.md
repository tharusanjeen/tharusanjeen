    Hi, I'm Sanjeen!
    
    Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA).
    
    I have a keen interest in web development, fascinated by the dynamic world of creating web applications and websites.
    
    Alongside web development, I'm passionate about penetration testing, delving into the world of cybersecurity to understand vulnerabilities and secure systems.
    
    Currently, I'm on a learning journey, diving deep into the realms of web development and Linux.

    I'm honing my skills in various web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Django.

    Simultaneously, I'm immersing myself in the Linux environment, exploring its intricacies, and mastering its command-line interface.

    My goal is to merge my passions for web development and penetration testing to contribute to creating secure and robust web applications in the future.

    I'm actively engaged in online communities and forums related to web development and cybersecurity, where I learn, share knowledge, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

    Always open to new opportunities and experiences that allow me to grow and expand my skills in the ever-evolving fields of technology.
