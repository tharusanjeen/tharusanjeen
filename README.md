Hi, I'm Sanjeen!

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) and am passionate about web development.

In web development, I specialize in building dynamic websites and web applications. I have a solid foundation in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and PHP. Additionally, I am exploring full-stack development with tools such as Node.js, Express, and MySQL. I’m also gaining expertise in the Django framework for Python-based web applications.

Currently, I’m focused on advancing my knowledge in web development and the Linux environment. I am actively working on MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) projects, which I plan to upload as soon as they are completed.

My goal is to create secure, high-performance web applications using the latest technologies.

I’m actively engaging in online communities related to web development, where I share knowledge, collaborate with others, and continue learning.

I'm always open to new opportunities that help me grow and expand my skills in this ever-evolving field.
